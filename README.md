# nes-open-db.github.io
A database for freely licensed NES software.

The goals of this project:

* Create an "App Store" type of experience for the distribution of NES homebrew software
* Provide explicit licensing information of each piece of software and metadata distributed on the site
* Provide a machine-readable API that can be accessed by NES emulators to provide beautiful metadata to go along with the game
* Create a promotional platform for NES Homebrew creators who are willing to distribute their homebrew under a permissive license
