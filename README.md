# nes-open-db.github.io
A database for freely licensed NES software.

The goals of this project:

* Create an "App Store" type of experience for the distribution of NES homebrew software for every major NES emulator out there
* Provide explicit licensing information of each piece of software and metadata distributed on the site
* Provide a machine-readable API that can be accessed by NES emulators to provide beautiful metadata to go along with the game
* Create a promotional platform for NES Homebrew creators who are willing to distribute their homebrew under a permissive license

## Sounds great! How can I help?

If you are a NES Homebrew developer and want your game listed, you can either send an email (details below) or open up an issue on the issue tracker of this project.

If you are a NES enthusiast that wants to curate the data or help in any other way, please contact me (details below) and tell me what you would like to do.

You can read more about contributing in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document in the root of this project.

Thank you for your support!
